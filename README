Colorzone use more soft colors for read comfortably but isn't dazzling .

Based on "tango-morning" and "wargreycolorscheme" color scheme.

Maybe has display problem in other file types, can works with both GUI and console.
You can chose another color for pop up menu.

I want change the colors to suitable for Tango Icon Theme Guidelines in the future.

If your terminal can use RGB colors, use this escape sequence colors:
ff888a85,ffef2929,ff8ae234,ffe9b96e,ff00bfff,ffda70d6,ff87ceeb,ffeeeeec
gray     red      green    yellow   blue     magenta  cyan     white
The Terminal colors and GUI colors are different.
